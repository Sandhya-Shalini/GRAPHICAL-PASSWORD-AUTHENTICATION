# GRAPHICAL-PASSWORD-AUTHENTICATION
The objective of a Graphical Password Authentication System is to enhance user authentication by utilizing images, patterns, or visual cues instead of traditional alphanumeric passwords. This system aims to increase security by offering more complex password options that are easier for users to remember but harder for attackers to guess.
